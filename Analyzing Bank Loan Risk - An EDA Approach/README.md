## General Information

##### **Business Understanding**:
> The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming a defaulter. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
> - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
> - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.


##### **Problem Statement**: 
> Suppose you work for a consumer finance company that specializes in providing various loan types to urban customers. Your task is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in the data, ensuring that applicants who are capable of repaying their loans are not unfairly rejected.

##### **Dataset**:
> Dataset has 3 files as explained below: 
> 1. 'application_data.csv' contains all the information of the client at the time of application.
The data is about whether a client has payment difficulties.
> 2. 'previous_application.csv' contains information about the client’s previous loan data. It contains the data on whether the previous application had been Approved, Cancelled, Refused or Unused offer.
> 3. 'columns_description.csv' is data dictionary which describes the meaning of the variables.

## Conclusions

##### Positive Correlation (Directly Related):
> - "AMT_GOODS_PRICE" is positively correlated to "LOAN_AMT_LAKHS"
> - "AMT_ANNUITY" is positively correlated to "LOAN_AMT_LAKHS"
> - "APPLICANT_AGE" shows positive correlation with "YEARS_OF_EMPLOYMENT", "DAYS_REGISTRATION" and "DAYS_ID_PUBLISH"


##### Negative Correlation (Inversely Related):
> - "FLAG_EMP_PHONE" is negatively correlated to "YEARS_OF_EMPLOYMENT" and "APPLICANT_AGE"
> - "HOURS_APPR_PROCESS_START" shows negative correlation with "REGION_RATING_CLIENT" and "REGION_RATING_CLIENT_W_CITY"
